On board he meets a girl. He fells in love with her when he sees this gorgeous woman. However after a few days the ship hits an enormous iceberg and the tragedy begins to unfold. The Titanic starts sinking and the movie is very close to the real tragedy. It shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprios and Kate Winslets performance is so brilliant that I cried during the whole movie.(Source: languages.ac.nz)',
